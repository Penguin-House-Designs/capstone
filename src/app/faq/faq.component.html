          1. Why should I get a home inspection?
        </mat-panel-title>
      </mat-expansion-panel-header>
      <p>As a buyer, it is important for you to have an inspection done on the home you are considering. Think of this like a “test drive” on a car you are buying. Let us test drive your home, to make sure we are detecting minor issues before they become
        major.</p>

      </mat-expansion-panel-header>
      <p>For most inspections, we will have two inspectors present to provide a quick yet thorough inspection. With two inspectors, you can plan on about 2 hours from start to finish. Of course if there is something that requires a bit more time, we want
        to take the time to provide you an excellent review of the home. We do our best to provide this quick service every single time. However, from time to time we will only have one inspector available. Your inspection timeline will be clear when
        scheduling the appointment.</p>

          11. What is radon?
        </mat-panel-title>
      </mat-expansion-panel-header>
      <p>Radon is a cancer-causing radioactive gas that is formed from the natural breakdown of uranium. You cannot see, smell or taste radon, but it may be a problem in your home. The Surgeon General has warned that radon is the second leading cause of
        lung cancer in the United States today. If you smoke and your home has high radon levels, you’re at high risk for developing lung cancer. Some scientific studies of radon exposure indicate that children may be more sensitive to radon.</p>

          12. Should I get a Radon test?
        </mat-panel-title>
      </mat-expansion-panel-header>
      <p>Testing is the only way to know your home’s radon levels. There are no immediate symptoms that will alert you to the presence of radon. It typically takes years of exposure before any problems surface. The US EPA, Surgeon General, American Lung
        Association, American Medical Association, and National Safety Council recommend testing your home for radon because testing is the only way to know your home’s radon levels.
